,19-RR-SOM-38014,Somalia,RR,Drought,2019,Somalia RR Application Jul 2019 (drought),,43669,43697,43647,19-08-2019,29922589,"Six out of seven rainy seasons have been poor since 2016, leaving people with no time to recover from one bad season to the next. The 2019 Gu rains (April to June) started late and have performed poorly and are to further aggravate the vulnerability of those who had not recovered from both the drought of 2016 and 2017 and the flooding in 2018. The Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit estimates that 5.4 million Somalis face acute food insecurity through September 2019 including a 40 per cent increase in the number of people in Crisis and Emergency (IPC3 and 4), from 1.5 to 2.2 million comprising rural (48%), internally displaced (40%) and urban (12%) people from the beginning of the year. The prevailing drought has also led to a nutrition emergency and households’ displacements. The drought also deteriorated the health situation with cholera, measles and other drought-borne disease outbreak. 
The 2019 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) focuses on four strategic objectives namely providing lifesaving assistance, nutrition, protection and resilience support to the most vulnerable and seeks US$1.08 billion to reach 3.4 million (including 2 million children) out of the 4.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.
The CERF application will cover US$ 30 million and includes 15 projects to support the Government’s response in providing immediate life and livelihoods assistance to 487,487 people (including 261,755 IDPs, 127,732 boys, 135,616 girls, 80,661 men, 143,478 women and 350 people with disabilities). The UN and NGOs have prioritized the most time-critical life-saving activities in the nutrition, WASH, food security/livelihoods, health, protection and Logistics sectors across the affected areas."
,19-RR-SOM-34946,Somalia,RR,Drought,2019,Somalia RR Application Mar 2019 (Drought),43509,43539,43565,43525,11-04-2019,11946861,"Despite some improvements in the overall humanitarian situation, significant needs persist in parts of Somalia. An estimated 2.6 million people remain internally displaced, either in rural areas or in informal settlements surrounding urban areas. Results from the 2018 Post-Deyr (October-December) seasonal Food Security and Nutrition Assessment indicate that 4.9 million Somalis, an increase from 4.6 million half a year ago, face acute food insecurity and will require humanitarian assistance and protection through mid-2019. Among these are 1.5 million people whose conditions are expected to deteriorate from Stressed (IPC Phase 2) to Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse between February and June due to the impact of below-average 2018 Deyr seasonal rainfall (October to December) compounded by the lingering effects of destitution and displacement from the 2016-2017 drought.  In addition, 903,100 children under the age of five years will likely face acute malnutrition in 2019, including 138,200 who are likely to be severely malnourished. Overall, almost half of the people in Crisis and Emergency resides in Somalia and Puntland  and require humanitarian assistance to reduce food consumption gaps and save livelihoods until the onset of the Gu rains when conditions improve. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) and poor rural households are particularly vulnerable, struggling to feed their families with diminished income.

This CERF allocation of US$12 million is to target the most critical areas in the north of Somalia where the severely food insecure population is at the highest risk of sliding from Crisis (IPC3) to Emergency (IPC4).  Communities will receive assistance in the sectors of Food Security, Health, Nutrition and WASH."
,18-RR-SOM-28714,Somalia,RR,Drought,2018,Somalia RR Application Mar 2018 (Drought),43151,43180,43202,43160,18-04-2018,12135443,"Despite the early and massive scale up of humanitarian assistance in Somalia in 2017, parts of northern Somalia experienced less than 40 percent of rainfall signalling a fourth failed season with consequent poor harvests and loss of livestock assets. Without assistance, the prospects of a fifth below average upcoming season are likely to lead to a reversal of the gains made in food and nutrition security. The humanitarian response requires nearly US$ 100 million; US$ 13 million from CERF is requested to jumpstart early action required to mitigate the effects of the deterioration of both food security and malnutrition among communities that continue to demonstrate worrying food security and/or nutrition outcomes (GAM of over 15%) and whose conditions are expected to deteriorate between February and June 2018. Over 183,000 IDPs and people from host communities are expected to benefit from this intervention."
,17-RR-SOM-25392,Somalia,RR,Drought,2017,Somalia RR Application Apr 2017 (Drought),42810,42837,42858,42821,10-05-2017,15033541,"The humanitarian situation in Somalia is rapidly deteriorating due to worsening drought conditions across the country caused by failure of three consecutive rainy seasons between 2015 and 2016, a prolonged dry Hagaa/Karan season (July to September 2016) and significantly below average Deyr rainfall (October to December 2016). Famine is possible in 2017 given the expectation of a below average Gu rainfall season between April to June 2017. Half of Somalia’s population of 6.2 million people are now facing acute food insecurity. Of these people, 2.9 million need urgent life-saving assistance, a drastic increase from the 1.1 million people in need six months ago.

For 2017, the total humanitarian needs are estimated at $864  million (this estimation is currently being revised to reflect the requirements to prevent famine). So far, only $369 million were received. Under this application, the Somalia HCT is requesting $14,994,093 to kick-start Health, Nutrition, WASH, NFI/Shelter and Logistics activities prioritized for the response to famine. With the CERF allocation the HCT intends to cover the urgent needs for up to 352,592 beneficiaries living in 13 vulnerable areas in Somalia."
,16-RR-SOM-19262,Somalia,RR,Drought,2016,"Somalia RR Application, Mar 2016 (El Niño)",,42439,42466.95286,42429,13-04-2016,11006301,"The effects of El Niño on Somalia were mixed with the anticipated heavier than normal rains and consequent riverine and flash floods in central and southern Somalia not materializing. The situation is very different in Puntland and Somaliland where rainfall was well below average during the 2015 Gu (April to June) and Karan (August to September) seasons. By September 2015, they had already experienced two consecutive poor rainy seasons and already experiencing drought conditions. In its August to December 2015 forecast, the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit projected that about 330,000 people in the seven regions of Puntland and Somaliland would be in IPC phases 4-Emergency and 3-Crisis. By February 2016, the number had risen to 385,000 and yet to be verified assessments indicate up to 500,000 people could be affected in the two regions.

The CERF allocation of $11 million will support the scaling up of time-critical lifesaving humanitarian assistance necessary to avert a deterioration of the drought-induced crisis over the next five months for 224,000 severely food insecure people through life-saving Food Security, Nutrition, Health and WASH interventions in the hardest hit areas of Somaliland and Puntland. Activities include provision of food through unconditional cash transfers, conditional lifesaving cash assistance including cash for work to restore community assets, vaccination of goats to contain the spread of Contagious Caprine Pleuroneumonia disease outbreak, therapeutic feeding support for treatment of moderate acute malnutrition cases among children under five years of age and pregnant and lactating women, provision of emergency health services addressing communicable diseases, maternal and child health,  supply of emergency health kits, water trucking, light rehabilitation of strategic water points and distribution of hygiene kits in drought affected areas."
